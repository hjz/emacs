;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  random-quote provides a simple mechanism to pick a random quote in a
;;  file. It is sufficient to put the file name containing the quotes in the
;;  `random-quote-file' variable. Next, at each invocation of
;;  `pick-random-quote', a string containing a random quote will be
;;  returned. The `random-quote-file' format has been kept as simpler as
;;  possible; at moment it simply consists in a quote per line.

;;; Installation:
;;
;;  Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path, then add one of the following
;;  to your ~/.emacs startup file.  You can load random-quote every time you
;;  start Emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'random-quote)

;;; Usage:
;;
;;  Do you really need help for this?

;;; Known Bugs:
;;
;;  Too simple to have one (hopefully ;-)

;;; Comments:
;;
;;  Any comments, suggestions, bug reports or upgrade requests are welcome.
;;  Please send them to Alessandro Di Marco (dmr@gmx.it).
;;
;;  This version of random-quote was developed and tested with GNU Emacs
;;  22.0.50.1 under Linux. Please, let me know if it works with other OS and
;;  versions of Emacs.
