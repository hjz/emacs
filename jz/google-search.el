;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Map this to a global key.  I use `C-c s'.  Highlight something in
;; XEmacs, hit this key sequence, and the highlighted region will be
;; sent to Google.

;;; Changelog (sort of)
;;
;; I hacked this a bit, created google-it and made it interactive.
;; Removed XEmacs-isms - buf was bound to (current-buffer) and passed
;; to region-{beginning,end} and buffer-substring, but those use
;; the current buffer by default (and in Emacs, they can't use others).
;; Also conditionalised use of region-exists-p.
