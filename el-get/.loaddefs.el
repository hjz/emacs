     `ace-jump-line-mode'

You can specify the sequence about which mode should enter
by customize `ace-jump-mode-submode-list'.

If you do not want to query char for word mode, you can change
`ace-jump-word-mode-use-query-char' to nil.

If you don't like the default move keys, you can change it by
setting `ace-jump-mode-move-keys'.

You can constrol whether use the case sensitive via
`ace-jump-mode-case-fold'.

as what it is: a tree.
